# Semantic MediaWiki as a docker container

![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wirehead/semantic-mediawiki-docker/master/icons/favicon-202x202.png)

A nice Helm chart designed for running [Semantic MediaWiki](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/) with a set of useful modules already installed.

**WORK IN PROGRESS WARNING**: I'm totally not finished messing with this.

## TL;DR;

```console
$ helm repo add wirehead https://wirehead.github.io/wirehead-charts
$ helm install wirehead/semanticmediawiki
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [SemanticMediaWiki](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

**By default, this runs with persistance turned off using the SQLite engine.**  If you want to configure persistance you probably want to set up a separate external database instance.  Most cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, et al) these days have a managed SQL database service that is arguably less trouble than running one inside of Kubernetes.  

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.13+ (It may work on older versions?)
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm install --name my-release semanticmediawiki
```
This will deploy a SemanticMediaWiki instance on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.  See the [configuration](#configuration) section to determine how to configure your instance.

**Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```
This will remove all components running on Kubernetes associated with this install.  

Note that it will not de-provision the database data if that's been configured.

## Configuration

## Persistence

SemanticMediaWiki has roughly two sets of state to persist.  Pages, history, et al are stored in a SQL database, either MariaDB/MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite3.  Uploaded file and the state of SemanticMediaWiki database updates are stored as files.

### Database

The default configuration is persistence off and a SQLite3 local database.

When I'm installing things that need a database in production on Kube clusters with Helm, I've found myself consistently turning off the bundled database that comes with charts, so I didn't feel it useful to include a database.

You can use either PostgreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB by setting `database.type`.

My assumption is that you've created a user and a database with the correct permissions ahead of time.

Something like this should work, for PostgreSQL:

```sql
CREATE ROLE mediawiki LOGIN PASSWORD '$MEDIAWIKIPASSWORD';
CREATE DATABASE my_wiki WITH OWNER mediawiki;
```

From here, the procedure looks like:

 * Set the `database.*` keys as necessary.
 * You can also create the secret without touching the chart and pull it in with `existingSecret`.
 * Set `provisionEnabled` to true once to trigger the database provisioner process, at which point you leave it set to false.

### Uploads

Images and the state of the SemanticMediaWiki migrations are stored in a mapped volume.  If you've turned on a database, you also need to persist uploads.

To persist this dataset, you want to set `persistence.enabled` to `true`.  You can use `persistence.existingClaim` to use an already created persistant volume.

Furthermore, if you want kubernetes to carefully not delete this volume if you delete the chart, maybe you want to set `persistence.resourcePolicy` to `Keep`.

## Advanced configuration details

### Using different MediaWiki containers

This will not work off of the stock MediaWiki containers.  

If you want to run a different wiki with different themes, plugins, et al, you probably want to set up your own docker container and builder and fork [the underlying container](https://github.com/wirehead/semantic-mediawiki-docker) 

## A few words on support

I'm running this for my own personal reasons, so I have at least some vested interest in keeping it functional and upgraded over time.  However, I'm not getting paid to do this.

## Upgrading

No upgrades yet.

## Changelog

Still on dev-ish
